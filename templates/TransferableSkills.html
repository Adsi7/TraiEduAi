                    <h1><b>Transferable Skills</b></h1>
                    <p>Our work is informed by various sources, including the <a
                            href="https://www.unicef.org/reports/global-framework-transferable-skills">Framework of
                            transferable skills
                            from UNICEF</a>. In today's rapidly changing world, it is vital to provide quality education
                        and learning opportunities that equip individuals with the necessary skills, knowledge,
                        attitudes and values to thrive throughout their lives. This includes the ability to learn,
                        unlearn and relearn, make informed choices, find meaningful work and participate actively in
                        their communities.

                        Education systems around the world often struggle to deliver positive outcomes because they tend
                        to focus primarily on the acquisition of knowledge. However, this approach falls short in
                        preparing individuals to meet the challenges and opportunities of the present and the future.
                        There is therefore an urgent need to expand, rethink and transform education and learning
                        systems to ensure that all individuals have access to quality learning opportunities that foster
                        the development of transferable skills, which are needed to succeed in different aspects of
                        life, including school, work and personal development. <br> <br>

                        <b>Cognitive skills</b> are closely tied to thinking processes and include problem-solving,
                        critical
                        thinking, decision-making, creativity, and goal-setting. They enable individuals to analyze
                        information, make informed choices, and develop strategies to overcome obstacles. Cognitive
                        skills
                        are instrumental in achieving academic success and fostering a lifelong love of learning.
                        <br> <br>
                        <b>Social skills</b> involve interaction and communication with others, encompassing effective
                        communication, collaboration, teamwork, conflict resolution, empathy, and cultural sensitivity.
                        These skills empower individuals to build positive relationships, work collaboratively in teams,
                        and
                        navigate social situations with respect and understanding. Social skills create inclusive
                        environments where everyone can thrive.
                        <br> <br>
                        <b>Emotional skills</b> refer to the ability to understand and manage one's own emotions, as
                        well as to
                        recognize and empathize with the emotions of others. They include self-awareness,
                        self-regulation,
                        resilience, empathy, and emotional intelligence. Emotional skills enable individuals to cope
                        with
                        stress, regulate their emotions, and cultivate positive mental well-being. These skills
                        contribute
                        to the development of healthy relationships and promote empathy and understanding in social
                        interactions.

                        these vital skills. Together, let us embark on a journey of lifelong learning and empowerment,

                        transferable
                        skills.
